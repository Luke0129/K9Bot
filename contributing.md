# Contribute To K9Bot

Community made patches, bug reports and contributions are always welcome.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that I can keep on top of things.

## Getting Started

* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Raise it on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Section214/K9Bot/issues)
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce the bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue as well as the version of Node you're using.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Make the changes to your forked repository
* When committing, reference your issue (if present) and include a note about the fix
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch of the K9 repository

## Code Documentation

* I ensure that every K9 function is documented well and follows the standards set by JSDoc
* Please make sure that every function is documented so that when I update the API Documentation things don't go awry!
   * If you're adding/editing a function in a class, make sure to add `@access {private|public|protected}`
* Finally, please use spaces and not tabs.

At this point you're waiting on me to merge your pull request. I'll review all pull requests, and make suggestions and changes if necessary.

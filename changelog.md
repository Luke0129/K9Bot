## v0.1.0 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* This is a super special release! K9 learned his first trick! He finally learned how to play ping-pong!
* We thought you might like to know what we're working on... so we added this nifty changelog with retroactive deets for your reading pleasure!
* We tried, we really did. Unfortunately, we didn't learn enough lessons with 0.0.3 and had to make adjustments again. Now we're logging in smarter...er.

## v0.0.3 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Login smarter... not harder. We used to do silly things with usernames and passwords every time you started K9... now we don't! Yay for tokens!
* Fixed ALL the invite codes! K9 can now actually join a server... not just login to one he was already in.
* Evil gremlins snuck into our code and make the config save function merge all our configs into one... this was not ideal, so we excised them.

## v0.0.2 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Still can't really do anything... but CAN login!

## v0.0.1 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Woot! First release! Sadly, doesn't do anything yet though...

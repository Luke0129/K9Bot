## v0.0.3 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Login smarter... not harder. We used to do silly things with usernames and passwords every time you started K9... now we don't! Yay for tokens!
* Fixed ALL the invite codes! K9 can now actually join a server... not just login to one he was already in.
* Evil gremlins snuck into our code and make the config save function merge all our configs into one... this was not ideal, so we excised them.

## v0.0.2 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Still can't really do anything... but CAN login!

## v0.0.1 / Mon, 22 Feb 2016
* Woot! First release! Sadly, doesn't do anything yet though...
